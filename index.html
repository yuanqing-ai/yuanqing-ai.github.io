<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am a senior majored in Electronic Information Engineering at <a href="https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/english/Home.htm">Glasgow College</a>, <a href="https://www.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>(Glasgow College, UESTC).</p>
<p>
I am currently working as a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Data Intelligence Group</a>, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by <a href="http://www.lxduan.info/" target="_blank">Prof. Lixin Duan</a>.
</p>
<p>
My recent research interests include: computer vision, deep learning (object detection, pose estimation), transfer learning (domain adaptation, instance refinement).
</p>
<h2>Research&Projects</h2>
<ul>

<li>Smart Inception Robot-TDPS</li>

<p> A project based smart inception robot was designed to perform two tasks on two different patios. Mutiple functions including path tracking, shape recognition, ultrasonic detection, wireless communication have been realized. This is a detailed description of the project [<a href="./files/Team-13_Final-Report.pdf">Report</a>]. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/MarcYu0303/2022-TDPS-Team-13">Project Page</a>.

<li>AIRPOSE Dataset</li>
<p>We have created a dataset <b>AIRPOSE</b> used for aircraft pose estimation, which includes 200k synthetic images and 10k real images with annotations of bounding boxs and keypoints. There are in total 12 keypoints defined for aircrafts. The sythetic images were generated using
    4 types of aircafts(Boeing 787, 747; Airbus 320, 330) in total 15 different liveries under 18 different camera positions and 7 different climate conditions (clear skies, scattered cloud, broken cloud, over cast, rain, snow, storm) in 115 different airports with various ligthing conditions. All of the 3D aircrafts are modeled realisticly according to the real world aircrafts and each airport is also modeled based on the corresponding real world airport. We used RTX 3070Ti for high quality rendering and obtained synthetic images of size 1920x1080.
</p>
<i><b>Notice</b></i> 
<p>This dataset is currently not open to the public as it is planned to be released officially in spring 2023 together with the publication of our research paper.
    <br/>Preview of the dataset is allowed for graduate admission committee only and the link to our dataset is provided in my CV submitted in online application. </p>
